\section{Introduction}

We have 3 methods: d3cs, spl, and sdi, which act in 2 stages:

Stage 1: d3cs yields rough initial time delay estimates (one per pair) as well as a characterization of the confidence that this delay estimate is not a catastrophic error. This confidence is encoded in 3 levels: "dou" for doubtless, "pla" for plausible, "mul" for multimodal.

Stage 2: spl or sdi build on top of the d3cs results, to increase accuracy and precision, but without changing the confidence level. The spl and sdi algorithms are inspired by the spline and regdiff methods from COSMOGRAIL, respectively. However, spl and sdi are simpler, faster, and also less conservative in their uncertainty estimation. There is no "safety margin" left.

For all three methods, our submissions are named according to the same convention: "pycs\_tdc1\_A-B-C-D.dt", where
 * A: method, that is d3cs, spl or sdi
 * B: method parameters ("vanilla" corresponds to the default settings, which we think are best or simplest)
 * C: confidence categories: "dou" for doubtless, "doupla" for both doubtless and plausible light curve pairs
 * D: filters that reject some delays following different criteria ("full" corresponds to no filter).

Submissions that share the same method and method parameters differ only in the selection/rejection of delays. The numerical values for delays and errors in these submissions are identical.

We analyzed all TDC1 curves, and so our submissions are "filled" with -99 flags. The only exception to this is the method "d3cs-mt", that saw only part of TDC1. Its submission files therefore do not cover the full TDC1.

If we would have to blindly select a single submission which is at the same time very ambitious in terms of P, f, and with a median chi2 hopefully close to 1, it would be
pycs\_tdc1\_spl-median-doupla-splagree.dt
It consists of the median of estimates from different spl variants, rejecting those delays for which the spl variants do not agree well.


Our submissions are grouped in various methods, each of them using different method parameters, then splitted into confidence categories, on which we finally apply different filters. That structure is reflected in the name of each submission, presented as pycs\_tdc1\_method-parameters-confidence-filter.dt

The first method, d3cs (for D3 Curve Shifting, D3 being a JavaScript applet), is based on an humain visualisation of the pairs, estimating the time delay and the time delay error by eye. Multiple estimations have been obtained for each pair, and have been carefully combined to get one single estimation per pair.

The second method, spl (for Spline), use the d3cs method estimations as input parameters. For each pair, shifted by the delay found with d3cs, the method fits a spline through both lightcurves, and adapt the delay to minimise the residuals of the data with respect to the spline. The presence of microlensing in one of the two lightcurves is taken into account when fitting the spline. The values of the delay and error are computed by applying the method on numerous copies and simulations of the original curves.

The third method, sdi (for Spline DIfference), also use the d3cs method estimations as input parmaeters. For each pair, the method fits a spline in each lightcurve, and then minimize the difference between the two splines, by shifting them in time around the d3cs input estimation. Again, the values of the delay and error are computed on copies and simulation of the original curves.
